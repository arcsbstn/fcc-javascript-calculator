# JavaScript Calculator

View the project [here](https://flamboyant-hamilton-0a68fc.netlify.app/).

My solution for the JavaScript Calculator project under freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries course.

This solution uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootsrap5 for the basic structure and styling. It also uses React to process button click events, calculation procedures, and output rendering.
